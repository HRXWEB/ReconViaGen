**🆕 News** — We've fixed some bugs in the [v0.5 branch](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/ReconViaGen/tree/v0.5?tab=readme-ov-file); please resynchronize with the remote repository. And we also deployed a [demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Stable-X/ReconViaGen-v0.5) on the huggingface space.

**🆕 News (v0.5)** — Releasing the inference code of ReconViaGen-v0.5 in the [v0.5 branch](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/ReconViaGen/tree/v0.5?tab=readme-ov-file) of this repository! Thanks for the excellent work [TRELLIS.2](https://github.com/microsoft/TRELLIS.2)! We have proposed an effective multi-view fusion strategy for TRELLIS.2, and then we combine ReconViaGen with TRELLIS.2 to enable the generation of high-resolution meshes and PBR materials.
For details, please refer to the [v0.5 branch](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/ReconViaGen/tree/v0.5?tab=readme-ov-file) of this repository.

**News (v0.2)** — Releasing the training and inference code of ReconViaGen-v0.2 in the [main branch](https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/ReconViaGen) of this repository! We have optimized the inference process. Reconstructing 16 images using ReconViaGen without refinement (app.py) consumes less than 18GB of VRAM.
Reconstructing 16 images using ReconViaGen (app_fine.py) consumes less than 24GB of VRAM.

**News (Community)** — An [unofficial implementation of ReconViaGen](https://github.com/estheryang11/ReconViaGen) is released! Thanks to [estheryang11](https://github.com/estheryang11) a lot!

## Installation (Blackwell inference)

Clone the repo:
```sh
git clone --recursive -b v0.5 https://github.com/GAP-LAB-CUHK-SZ/ReconViaGen.git
cd ReconViaGen
```

The supported inference environment is:

- Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64
- Python 3.10 (managed by uv)
- GeForce RTX 5090 or RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell (`sm_120`)
- NVIDIA driver 570 or newer
- CUDA Toolkit 12.8, including `nvcc`
- PyTorch 2.7.1 with CUDA 12.8

The CUDA runtime bundled with PyTorch is not a replacement for CUDA Toolkit 12.8: the full toolkit is required to compile the CUDA extensions. Verify the host before installing:

```sh
nvidia-smi
nvcc --version
```

Install the system build tools and uv, then synchronize the locked Python environment:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y build-essential git libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglib2.0-0 libjpeg-dev
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
uv sync --frozen
```

Compile the CUDA extensions specifically for Blackwell and run the smoke check:

```sh
./scripts/install_blackwell.sh
uv run --no-sync python scripts/check_blackwell.py
```

The extension installer validates Ubuntu 22.04, driver 570+, CUDA Toolkit 12.8, PyTorch 2.7.1+cu128, and compute capability 12.0 before building. It pins every external CUDA source repository to an immutable commit and sets `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST=12.0`.

The previous Conda-based `setup.sh` and `setup_update.sh` target PyTorch 2.4/CUDA 12.1 and are not supported on Blackwell.

### Updating the lockfile

`uv.lock` resolves only Linux x86_64 packages. It can still be generated on another host, including macOS, because locking reads distribution metadata without installing or importing the selected CUDA wheels:

```sh
uv lock --python 3.10
uv lock --check
```

macOS inference and `uv sync` are not supported. CUDA extensions are intentionally installed outside the lockfile and must be compiled on the target Ubuntu GPU host. After compiling them, use `uv run --no-sync` or `.venv/bin/python`; a later exact `uv sync` can remove packages installed outside the lockfile, in which case the extension installer must be run again.

## Local Demo 🤗

Run the script to reconstruct the object:
```sh
uv run --no-sync python app_v05.py
```

## Method Overview

ReconViaGen-v0.5 adopts a four-stage hybrid pipeline, combining ReconViaGen's multi-view-aware sparse structure estimation with TRELLIS.2's high-resolution generation:

**Stage 1 · ReconViaGen**
- Input: one or more RGBA images (video frame extraction is also supported)
- VGGT-based multi-view feature extractor generates sparse structure coordinates
- Output: sparse voxel coordinates at 32³ resolution

**Stage 2 · Shape SLat (TRELLIS.2)**
- Conditioned on the Stage 1 sparse coordinates, a Shape SLat Flow Matching model generates the Shape Sparse Latent
- Output: sparse latent encoding high-quality geometry
- Multi-image fusion strategies: `adaptive_guidance_weight` (default), `weighted_average`, `sequential`, etc.

**Stage 3 · Texture SLat (TRELLIS.2)**
- Conditioned on the Shape SLat from Stage 2, generates a Texture Sparse Latent with PBR material attributes (Base Color, Metallic, Roughness)
- Multi-image fusion strategies: `adaptive_guidance_weight` (default), `weighted_average`, `sequential`, etc.

## Multi-view Fusion Strategies

We explore six strategies, which are available via the `strategy` parameter. Empirically, **the `adaptive_guidance_weight` is the best choice.**

| Strategy | Passes / Step | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **`sequential`** | 2 | At denoising step *i*, uses `images[i % N]` as the sole condition — the cheapest option. Each step sees only one view, so multi-view coherence relies on the cyclic ordering of images across steps. |
| **`average`** | 2N | Runs full CFG independently for every image (1 uncond + 1 cond call **per view**), then averages the `pred_x_prev` tensors. Because CFG and its rescale are applied separately per image, a slight bias is introduced when `guidance_rescale > 0`. |
| **`average_right`** | N+1 | Correct Product-of-Experts (PoE) multi-image CFG. One shared uncond call + N cond calls; conditional velocities are **equally averaged**, then CFG (including rescale) is applied **once** on the blended result — eliminating the per-image rescale bias of `average` while halving the forward-pass cost. |
| **`weighted_average`** | N+1 | Same architecture as `average_right` (1 uncond + N cond, CFG once). At each denoising step, **per latent token**, the weight of view *i* is `softmax(−‖v_cond_i − mean_v‖)` where `mean_v` is the cross-view mean velocity. Views whose velocity deviates the least from the consensus receive higher weight, locally suppressing occluded or specular views without penalising them globally. |
| **`adaptive_guidance_weight`** | N+1 | Same architecture as `average_right`. Per-token weight = **guidance magnitude** `‖v_cond_i − v_uncond‖` — a direct proxy for how strongly the model "sees" the corresponding surface region under view *i* (occluded/specular regions produce small guidance signals and are naturally down-weighted). A t-adaptive temperature is used: early steps (t≈1) → near-uniform weights for stable global structure; late steps (t≈0) → sharpened weights so the most confident views drive fine-detail refinement. |
| **`fixed_guidance_rescale`** | N+1 | Theoretically correct PoE with **per-view independent rescale**. `average_right` computes the rescale reference from the *averaged* velocity, which under-estimates variance when views disagree. This strategy instead applies CFG at strength `gs/N` and rescale *independently* for each view (using each view's own `std(x0_cond_i)` as the reference), then combines via PoE: `v_final = Σᵢ v_i_rescaled − (N−1)·v_uncond`. Degrades exactly to `average_right` when `guidance_rescale=0` or all views agree. |
